# MyWifiPass

**MyWifiPass** is a comprehensive tool environment designed to simplify and streamline the implementation of EAP-TLS authentication methods in enterprise wireless networks.

## Overview

In today's environments, securing wireless networks with robust authentication mechanisms is crucial. EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security) provides one of the most secure authentication methods available, using digital certificates for both client and server authentication. However, implementing and managing EAP-TLS can be complex and time-consuming.

MyWifiPass addresses these challenges by providing an integrated solution that combines:
- **Certificate Management**: Automated generation of digital certificates for Wi-Fi clients and networks.
- **RADIUS Server Integration**: Automated configuration of a FreeRADIUS server, providing the configurations of every managed network.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web-based dashboard for managing Wi-Fi clients and networks.
- **Android App**: Automated configuration of networks in an Android app. 
- **Network Management**: Integrations with OpenWISP for centralized access point configuration and monitoring.





## Parts 

At the moment, MyWifiPass is formed of two main tools:

### MyWifiPass System
